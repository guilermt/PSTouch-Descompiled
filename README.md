Adobe Photoshop Touch is an image editing application for mobile devices, which offers tools similar to those of desktop Photoshop. It allows you to separate layers of an image and use adjustment hardware to combine images in new and interesting ways. The application also includes an integrated camera function that can be used to pre-fill areas with the unique Camera Fill hardware. In addition, Photoshop Touch allows you to easily share work on social media such as Facebook, Twitter or other registered applications in a very simple way. The app also lets you locate images using a Google image search and embed them into your work. Adobe Photoshop Touch offers a variety of features and tools to help users edit photos and create stunning visual designs on their mobile devices. However, Adobe Photoshop Touch was discontinued by Adobe in 2015, despite continuing to use by some users.
